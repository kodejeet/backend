# Backend Learning Repository

This repository is a collection of backend projects and experiments created while learning **Node.js** and server-side development. It follows the **MVC architecture** and covers several backend concepts such as routing, controllers, middlewares, authentication, API handling, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

backend/
├── basics/ # Introductory concepts and experiments
├── controllers/ # Request handlers (business logic)
├── https-server/ # HTTPS setup and experimentation
├── middlewares/ # General-purpose middleware
├── middlewares-authentication/ # Auth-specific middleware examples
├── models/ # Data models and schema (if using DB)
├── routes/ # API route definitions
├── views/ # Placeholder for templating (if needed)
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── index.js # Entry point or connection logic


## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Setting up an Express server
- Working with routes and controllers
- Middleware functions (custom and built-in)
- Basic authentication/authorization patterns
- HTTPS server setup
- Modular project structuring using MVC principles
- Using mock data to simulate APIs

## 🧠 Purpose

This is a **learning-oriented** repository — code here is written for practice and understanding, not production. It may contain:
- Experimental approaches
- Refactored sections for comparison
- Examples of Node.js features and use-cases

## 📌 Notes

- No real database is connected yet; mock data is used in some modules
- Folder names and file structures are designed to reinforce backend architectural patterns
- Some folders (like `basics`) may contain earlier or isolated learning code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTTPS module (built-in)
- VS Code for development

## 📚 Learning Journey

This repo will keep evolving as I explore more backend topics — such as:
- Connecting MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- JWT authentication
- File uploads
- WebSocket communication
- Deployment practices
